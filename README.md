>Status: Developing 🧗

This is a simple website that I am developing while improving my web developing skills. It is, as its name suggests, a cook book.

## Origin
One of my favorite hobbies is cooking, but unfortunately I sometimes forget some recipes that I just loved cooking *and eating*. So when I first started learning about web development I thought it would be neat to just make a cook book where I could store all my favorite recipes so that I never forget how to prepare them! And plus, now they will taste like "I am learning something new 😋"

## Categories
To better organize everything and make my recipes easier to find, I decided to categorize them, but to make everything sound nicer the common names weren't enough, so in ***My cook book*** they go like this:

**Category Name**|**Meaning**
-----------------|-----------
**Sugar touch**|For desserts and sweet food in general 🍫
**Baked goodies**|For everything that has to go into an oven 🥐
**Soul warmers**|For soups, brothes and stews 🥣
**Veggies**|For vegetable-based recipes 🥙

## Features
* ✔️ Browsing and displaying recipes
* ✔️ Spring Boot Backend
* ⭕ Dark theme
* ⭕ Find recipes you can prepare selecting the ingredients you have at home
* ✔️ Go to a random recipe
